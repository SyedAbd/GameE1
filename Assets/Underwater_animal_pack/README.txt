****UNDERWATER ANIMAL PACK****

Pack structure:




1.Animals 

Pack includes almost 100 different animal species. Animals that are rigged have two or three animations applied on model. Most of animals have swim, fastswim and eat (bite) animations.
Rigging or animations can be easily changed with any modeling software that supports fbx files.

All animal models have required textures and material in pack. Three different textures are provided: diffuse, specular and normal map. 
Specular maps are not used in example materials, but i have included specular textures for those who would like to use custom shader that supports external specular texture. It is suggested that you use external specular maps if possible, becouse it gives better results. 
Some animals have two different material / texture versions to achieve more variation or to simulate male / female genre. 
Version 1 material does not have any suffixes, version 2 has suffix _v2.




2.Example scenes

Scene named "assets" is provided where all animals are sorted in scene. Animals were not added to prefabs becouse some users still use Unity 3.4 or older, where Unity 3.5 prefabs are not usefull.



3.Scripts

Script included is: AnimationBlending.

Mobile and low-end computer use:
For mobile or older computers it is suggested that you reduce texture size, which can be easily done in Unity editor, simply by selecting texture and using specified maximum size.



IMPORTANT:

Not all animals are rigged and animated. Animation quallity is not that good, since those were my first attempts on animations, it is recomended that you check example video to see some examples:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRq41kmi-1E&list=UUQ2fajc6hR0C6tg5lMBPxXA&index=1&feature=plcp
